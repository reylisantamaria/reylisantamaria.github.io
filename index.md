## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 6, part 2 

    This lab is what really changed it for me at the beginning. I wasn't aware on how to play BlackJack so this was a learning experience and a fun one at that. We applied various conditions and utilized numerous 'if' statements in a real world example, which made it even more enjoyable since I got to put more of what I’d learned into practice.

* Lab 11, part 2 

    This is my second favorite. It was my first time using classes and constructors, so it was a really cool learning experience. The Hi-Lo game is simple—it builds off a past lab where you guess a secret number with hints—but using class objects and random number generators to manage things like the secret number and remaining guesses made it feel much more real. Plus, seeing it all come together with was super satisfying. It was a fun way to get the hang of how classes work.

* Lab 12 

    This is my all time favorite because I liked all the parts to this lab. In part 1, we made our first animation, which was such a fun way to dive into creating something visual with code. Then in Part 2, we worked on “Beautiful Noise,” where we made a GIF with randomly generated pixels with colors and text over it. Watching it produce an actual gif was amazing and fun to look at.
